My Vim Settings

Installing:
----------------------

Fork and then clone this repository, putting the .vim folder in your root directory:

    git clone git://github.com/ElliotPenson/.vim.git

By default, vim will look for the .vimrc configuration file in your root directory. However, one way to get around that is with a symlink. Perform the following to make a .vimrc alias which will point the actual .vimrc file in .vim:

    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
